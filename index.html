            <p>
            Dog's help us gain a sense of responsibility, show us unconditional love, and are always there when we need them. Why do dogs make us better humans?
            Studies have shown that dopamine, oxytocin, and serotonin are released when human beings interact with dogs. These neurotransmitters are in a way responsible for our happiness and they also ameliorate the effects of depression.

            <h2 class="right-side-heading">Empower Your Dog</h2>
            <p>
                Training is an essential part of owning a dog and can be started at any age. Training builds confidence, provides mental stimulation and strengthens the human-animal bond. Dogs are always learning.
                It provides mental stimulation which helps to keep your dog happy, and if combined with morning exercise your dog will be mentally and physically tired at the end and far more likely to sleep during the day.
