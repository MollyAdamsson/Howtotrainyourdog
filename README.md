## Design and layout

* ### Font
* The lettering style chosen for the sites headings is 'Roboto slab' and 'Poppins for the body text. Both of them have a fall back of sans-serif.
* 'Roboto slab' was chosen to give a forward and direct introduction to the site.
* 'Poppins' was applied to give a soft contrast to the heading.
* The color scheme that is chosen was to give the feeling of nature and wild life. The blue and green matches very well together, and most certainly they match with the nature pictures of the dogs.
