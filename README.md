# Design and layout

* ### Font

* The lettering style chosen for the sites headings is 'Roboto slab' and 'Poppins' for the body text. Both of them have a fall back of sans-serif.
* 'Roboto slab' was chosen to give a forward and direct introduction to the site.
* 'Poppins' was applied to give a soft contrast to the heading.
* The color scheme and layout that is chosen was to give the feeling of nature and wild life. The blue and green matches very well together, and most certainly they match with the nature pictures of the dogs.

# Testing

* The page is tested in different browsers, such as: Chrome, Safari and Firefox
* It is easy to navigate between the sections, the media links work and opens a new tab and the form on the sign up page works.
* It is also tested and confirmed that the heading, navigation, media links and text are readable and understandable.
* It is confirmed that the page works on all media devices through the devtools device side bar.
* Different layouts for the the different media devices was tested, this was made to make sure that it looked good and that the user easily could navigate and understand. This led to the decision to remove the hero image from the smartphone device, mostly to make it look more clean and to minimize the risk of making the image look too cramped up.

### Bugs

* There has been some small issues along the way, when the code did not behave the way it was expected to and such. When that occured, the main focus was to check it via the W3C Markup Validation Service, link to the site can be found here - https://validator.w3.org/
* The problem that occured had to do with the the three boxes with inofmration that did not line up the way it should. The boxes were uneven. 
* The code was run thorugh the validator, it marked were the problem were and it was then corrected.

### Validator testing
